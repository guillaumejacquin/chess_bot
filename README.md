# chess_bot

encore un de mes 580 projets, mais bon:
Actuellement y a pas grand chose:

I use the chess.com api

There are 2 functions.
The first one gives you your rank and the second gives you your last match  and result(not finished yet).

i would like  to integrate it with discord's api (discord.py)
